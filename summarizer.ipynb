       "\"I can't provide you with the exact embedding model used by Gemini. This is because:\\n\\n* **It's proprietary:** Google keeps the details of its large language model architectures and specific embedding models confidential. This is common for companies developing advanced AI systems, as it protects their intellectual property and competitive advantage.\\n* **It's constantly evolving:** Gemini is likely under continuous development, with improvements and changes being made to its architecture and embedding models.\\n\\nHowever, I can give you some general insights into the type of embedding models used in large language models like Gemini:\\n\\n**What are Embeddings?**\\n\\n* Embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or even entire documents as numerical vectors. These vectors capture the meaning and relationship of these elements in a way that can be understood by a machine learning model.\\n* In the context of language models, embeddings are crucial for tasks like:\\n    * **Understanding the meaning of text:**  The model can analyze the relationships between words based on their embeddings.\\n    * **Generating coherent text:** By considering the embeddings of words, the model can predict the next most likely words in a sequence.\\n    * **Performing tasks like question answering and translation:** By comparing the embeddings of different texts, the model can find similarities and relationships.\\n\\n**Types of Embedding Models:**\\n\\n* **Word2Vec and GloVe:** These are some of the earlier and well-known models that create dense vector representations for individual words.\\n* **Contextual Embeddings (like BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-3):** These models are more powerful as they capture the context in which a word appears, making the embeddings more nuanced and informative.\\n* **Sentence Embeddings:** These models create embeddings for entire sentences or paragraphs, capturing the meaning of the text as a whole.\\n\\n**What Gemini Might Use:**\\n\\n* **Custom Embeddings:** It's likely that Gemini uses its own custom embedding models, optimized for its specific architecture and the vast amount of data it was trained on. This allows for highly accurate and efficient semantic representation.\\n* **Combination of Different Techniques:** Gemini could potentially combine multiple embedding techniques, drawing on the strengths of each to create the most comprehensive representations of language.\\n\\n**How to Explore Similar Approaches:**\\n\\n* **Publicly Available Embeddings:** Many open-source embedding models are available, such as:\\n    * **Hugging Face Model Hub:**  https://huggingface.co/models \\n    * **Gensim:** https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ \\n* **Experimentation:**  You can explore and fine-tune different embedding models to see how they perform on your specific tasks. \\n\\nRemember, the details of Gemini's internal workings are not publicly available, but understanding the general concepts of embeddings and their application in language models will give you a good foundation for exploring related research and technologies. \\n\""

He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional medium-fast bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic cricket. Kohli is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He holds the record as the highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international cricket. He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup, 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in 2017, 2018,  and 2019.'),\n",
